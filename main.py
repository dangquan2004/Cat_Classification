What do this project helps me learn:

- Preprocess the data is IMPORTANT
    + Figure out the dimension and shapes of the problem
    + Reshape the datasets such that each example is now a vector of size (num_px * num_px * 3, 1)
    + Standardize the data
- Implemented each function separately: initialize(), propagate(), optimize(). Then built a model().
